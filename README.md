# Josim Sekh
I’m a passionate web developer and programmer with hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I love creating small, functional, and creative web projects—many of which I’ve showcased here. Each website you see is built by me, often as part of my personal experiments and learning journey. Feel free to explore and get inspired! (Josim Sekh)
